And now that we’ve got a new murder mystery on our hands, we’re eager to piece together the puzzle and reveal the culprit. So, let’s get down to business. We’ll start by addressing <a href=#>the question</a> we all want to know the answer to: Who was in Ben’s dressing room before he died?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>At the end of Episode 3, we learned that Ben engaged in quite a heated, yet intimate discussion with a special somebody. And that somebody may have <a href=#>killed off Paul Rudd’s character</a>. So, let’s untangle the details and see who it might be.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who was in Ben Glenroy's dressing room before he collapsed on stage?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Thanks to the camera <a href=#>Jesse Williams</a>’s character Tobert (that’s pronounced Robert with a “T”) had recording inside Ben’s dressing room just before he made his debut on stage for Death Rattle, we now know Ben wasn’t alone before the show. While we can’t see who Ben is talking to or if they were an item, we do know there was chemistry between the two.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“I want you, I want you so f--king bad, but you’re going to ruin my career,” Ben professes to the unknown person. He then leaps from his seat and declares “And I’m gonna like it.” At this point, we’re assuming the two share a steamy kiss. So, who is it? Initially, it was assumed that Kimber (<a href=#>Ashley Park</a>) was the person in Ben’s dressing room just before he collapsed on stage.</p><p>However, after Mabel chatted with her at the theater, we're now thinking it may be someone else. Someone like, Joy (Andrea Martin)?</p><p>After all, it was Joy's lipstick that was recovered from Ben's dressing room and likely used to write "F--KING PIG" on his mirror.<strong> </strong>But, if we've learned anything from Only Murders in the Building murder mysteries, it's that you can't always take a clue for face value. In other words, Joy's lipstick could have been planted.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Kimber kill Ben Glenroy in ‘Only Murders in the Building’?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Kimber was initially a person of interest in Ben's death when she couldn't produce her Death Rattle-themed hankie. When Charles (<a href=#>Steve Martin</a>) asked her for it, she hesitantly replied, “I must have thrown it away or donated it to a good cause.” And thanks to Mabel (<a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>), we think Ben grabbed his killer’s hankie just before plunging to his death.</p><p>However, we later learn that Kimber sold her hankie on eBay after Ben backed out of endorsing her anti-aging serum.</p><p>Still, what might have been Ben's final public conversation with Kimber still sticks out. When Ben “came back to life," he had a few choice words for Loretta, but apologized to Kimber for making things so messy.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The final clue that had us pointing at Kimber is her desire to be in the limelight. Although Kimber initially came off as this quiet, easy-going woman, her true colors shone through after Loretta put on a striking performance for Donna (Linda Emond) and her son (which, by the way, ultimately saved <a href=#>Oliver’s (Martin Short) show</a>).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p>Meryl Streep and Ashley Park perform “Look for the Light,” written by Sara Bareilles.</p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After singing her heart out alongside <a href=#>Meryl Streep</a>’s character, Kimber’s voice trails off and begins to narrate. “When a spark catches fire, the only place you want to be is at the center of that fire. But, if one person is shining a little brighter than the others, sometimes you can't help it, it's a competitive business, you may need to snuff them out.”</p><p>Did Kimber just say you need to wipe out your competition when they steal the spotlight? It sure did sound like it! Watch out, Loretta!</p><p>While we don’t know if Kimber actually carried out the crime considering Joy has expressed she's willing to go to any length to "protect" Charles and her lipstick was found in Ben's dressing room, we’re keeping a close eye on the aspiring actor.</p><p>Catch new episodes of Only Murders in the Building Season 3 every Tuesday at 12 a.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwedaaqmahnmKvprrSZpurnaOotq%2BzjKumqKVdl7Knu9GeZKGdXZm2prCMqKWlsV2iwrOwxKuqZqGeYsGpsYybrKKklJ67qA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ambrosia-salad.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ambrosia Salad Modern Honey</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ji-chang-wook-girlfriend-and-dating-history.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Korean Actor Ji Chang-Wook's Relationship Status?
