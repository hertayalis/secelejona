"It's something I have always wanted to do. I love building my characters from the ground up, and producing gives me the chance to do that on a greater scale.</p><p id=elxpwIgW3ei data-wc=52>"I find it fascinating," she continues. "There are so many elements and people that have to come together to make a movie work, even before an actor shows up on set. I love being part of that process from the beginning to the end.
