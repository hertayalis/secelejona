In his subsequent stint from 2012 to 2021, the Patriots clinched three Super Bowl championships in Super Bowl XLIX, Super Bowl LI, and Super Bowl LIII.</p><p>McDaniels also had the distinction of being present for all six of the Patriots’ titles during the Brady-Belichick era, alongside other notable figures such as Greg Debeljak, who recruited him from Canton McKinley High School, and Nick Caserio, who joined the Patriots staff in the same year as McDaniels.</p><p>McDaniels’ collegiate football experience at John Carroll University from 1995 to 1998 primarily involved playing as a wide receiver, despite having been a quarterback in high school.</p><p>His teammates at John Carroll included London Fletcher, a former linebacker for the St. Louis Rams, Buffalo Bills, and Washington Redskins, as well as Brian Polian, the former head coach at the University of Nevada-Reno, Jerry Schuplinski, the quarterbacks coach for the New York Giants, Tom Telesco, the general manager of the Los Angeles Chargers, and Dave Ziegler, the general manager of the Las Vegas Raiders.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Starting his coaching journey as a senior graduate assistant at Michigan State University in 1999, McDaniels was under the tutelage of Nick Saban, leveraging his father’s friendship with the renowned coach. Following his stint at Michigan State, McDaniels transitioned to Cleveland where he served as a sales representative for plastics.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-happened-to-josh-mcdaniels-raiders-sacking-explored><strong>What happened to Josh McDaniels: Raiders sacking explored</strong></h2><p>The Las Vegas Raiders announced on Tuesday night that general manager Dave Ziegler and coach Josh McDaniels had been sacked.</p><p>“After much thought about what the Raiders need to move forward, I have decided to part ways with Josh and Dave,” owner Mark Davis said in a statement. “I want to thank them both for their hard work and wish them and their families nothing but the best.”</p><p>When pressed to elucidate the reasons behind the terminations over the phone, Davis responded to ESPN with, “No comment at this time.” Antonio Pierce, the Raiders’ linebackers coach, has been named the team’s acting head coach. Champ Kelly, the team’s current assistant general manager, will take over as interim general manager. The organization said in a statement that following the promotions, it will conduct “a comprehensive search” for a general manager and head coach “once the season is complete.” Along with Mick Lombardi, the Raiders also sacked him as offensive coordinator, sources informed ESPN’s Adam Schefter on Wednesday. According to sources who spoke with ESPN and verified an NFL Network report, quarterbacks coach Bo Hardegree would be promoted to offensive coordinator and take over offensive playcalling, which had been handled by McDaniels.</p><p>The move comes one day after the&nbsp;Raiders lost 26-14&nbsp;at&nbsp;Detroit&nbsp;on “Monday Night Football,” Las Vegas’ second consecutive defeat in which the team’s offense could get no traction. With the defeat, the Raiders dropped to 3-5.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-josh-mcdaniels-wife-who-is-laura-mcdaniels><strong>Josh McDaniels wife: Who is Laura McDaniels?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ghbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/josh-696x560.jpg><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Josh McDaniels’s wife, Laura McDaniels, has garnered attention in connection with this report.
