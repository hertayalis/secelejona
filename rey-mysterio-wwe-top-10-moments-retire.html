Here SunSport runs through his best WWE moments...<br></p><h2>RUMBLE RETURN</h2><p>Fitting that the first entrant in the list is the most recent one.</p><p>Mysterio left WWE back in 2015 under a cloud following a succession of injuries but he revitalised his career working for Lucha Underground and other independent wrestling promotions.</p><p>The Mexican-American then received a huge ovation as he made his return to the company in the 2018 Royal Rumble after a three-year absence.</p><p>Mysterio entered at number 27 and eliminated Adam Cole before he was sent over the ropes by Finn Balor.</p><p></p><h2>TRIBUTE TO EDDIE</h2><p>The night after his close friend Eddie Guerrero unexpectedly passed away, Rey Mysterio chose to still compete in memory of Latino Heat.</p><p>His opponent would be a first-time meeting with Shawn Michaels with both Superstars donning black armbands emblazoned with a white "EG."</p><p>Following an engaging back and forth between the two WWE greats, Mysterio hit HBK with a surprise 619 and earned the win with a springboard splash.</p><p>But the match will be best remembered for Rey helping Michaels to his feet after the bell and the two embracing in front of the emotional RAW crowd.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/11.jpg><h2>SHAVING CM PUNK'S HAIR</h2><p>Before he was the voice of the voiceless, CM Punk had taken over WWE with his Straight Edge Society stable.</p><p>The former UFC star was desperate to recruit Mysterio to his faction and the two became involved in one of the most underrated feuds of the decade.</p><p>Coming into the Over The Limit PPV, the two were tied at one win a-piece following matches at&nbsp;WrestleMania 26, and then Extreme Rules.</p><p>Their third clash came with the stipulation that Mysterio would join the Straight Edge Society if he lost, while Punk would surrender his hair if he was defeated.</p><p>Rey ultimately received an unlikely assist from Kane as he dropped the Best in the World with a seated crucifix for the win and then sheared his greasy locks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20_OTL10_Photo_072.jpg><p></p><h2>CRUISERWEIGHT KING</h2><p>Mysterio made his name at WCW in 1995 where he popularised the lucha libre fighting style before jumping ship to WWE in 2002 after the company folded.</p><p>After just a year with Vince McMahon's company, the Ultimate Underdog claimed his first singles championship.</p><p>Mysterio defeated Matt Hardy to win the first of his three Cruiserweight titles in front of his wife Angie, son Dominick and daughter Aalyah.</p><h2>CHAVO QUITS</h2><p>WWE controversially used the passing of Eddie Guerrero to ignite a feud between his nephew Chavo and family friend Mysterio.</p><p>Despite the poor taste surrounding the storyline, both Superstars became the only two to have more than one 'I Quit' match against the same opponent.</p><p>First, Mysterio and Chavo put on one of the greatest matches in SmackDown history with their clash in 2006, with Guerrero emerging victorious.</p><p>But Rey avenged the loss almost a year later in another 'I Quit' match on the blue brand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/11_display_image.jpg><h2>DREAM SABU MATCH</h2><p>WWE fans reacted negatively to ECWâ€™s One Night Stand 2006 that was best remembered for the heated WWE Title Match between John Cena and Rob Van Dam.</p><p>But the PPV did have an absolute gem of a match between Rey Mysterio and unpredictable Arabian icon Sabu for the World Heavyweight title.</p><p>The Master of the 619, wrestling in old school ECW tights, put on a hell of a stunt show with the self-proclaimed homicidal, suicidal, genocidal death-defying Maniac.</p><p>Although the finish of the match is still hotly debated as WWE called a no-contest at the Hammerstein Ballroom after Sabu put Mysterio through a table with a triple jump DDT.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-11.jpg><p></p><h2>RETIRING JBL</h2><p>Hall of Famer and Grand Slam Champion John Bradshaw Layfield's illustrious in-ring career came to a stunning end at WrestleMania 25.</p><p>Despite becoming the longest reigning WWE champion in SmackDown history, the future RAW commentator surrendered his Intercontentinal gold to Rey Mysterio in embarrassing fashion.</p><p>In a 21-second squash match, JBL was hit by a quick-fire drop-kick and 619 before grabbing the microphone to scream the words "I Quit."</p><p></p><h2>WINNING CUSTODY OF DOMINICK</h2><p>In true WWE style, Mysterio was involved in a storyline with Eddie Guerrero where Latino Heat claimed to be the biological father of Rey's real-life son Dominick.</p><p>The two settled the case in a Ladder match at SummerSlam 2005 with the briefcase containing the custody papers.</p><p>The emotionally-charged affair saw Dominick enter the match to aide his father Rey, while Vickie Guerrero ultimately cost her husband the match by pushing Eddie off the ladder.</p><p>Mysterio has since revealed that this match is his favorite match that he ever had in WWE.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/rey-1.jpg><p></p><h2>RUMBLE WINNER</h2><p>The biggest underdog in WWE history defied the company's attitudes to wrestlers his size by winning the 2006 Royal Rumble.</p><p>On a night he dedicated to his late friend Eddie, Mysterio entered the 30-man, over-the-top battle royal in the No. 2 position.</p><p>The Masked One held on for more than an hour to set the record for the longest time in a Rumble Match as he eliminated six other Superstars.</p><p>The last two were Triple H and Randy Orton, who Mysterio turfed over the ropes to&nbsp;earn himself a World Heavyweight Championship opportunity at WrestleMania 22.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/m-1.jpg><p></p><h2>TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN</h2><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most Read in WWE</h2></p><p>A 15-year-old Rey Mysterio once dreamt of capturing the World Heavyweight title at WrestleMania when he began learning his trade in a church basement.</p><p>And that vision became a reality in 2006 when The Ultimate Underdog defeated Randy Orton and Kurt Angle in a Triple Threat Match on The Grandest Stage of Them All.</p><p>Mysterio has had many far superior technical matches during his glittering WWE career, but no single moment outweighs the companies' best 'little man' reaching the top of the mountain.</p><p></p><p class=postsid
