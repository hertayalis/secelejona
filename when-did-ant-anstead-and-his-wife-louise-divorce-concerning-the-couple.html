Ant is an English TV personality and vehicle builder, but Louise has kept her professional life private. The devoted pair was deeply in love throughout their long marriage. Things did not go as planned, and the pair decided to split up.</strong></p><p>We’ll look at how their marriage went, why they split, and where they are today in this article.</p><h2><span id=What_Happened_to_Ant_and_Louise8217s_Marriage>What Happened to Ant and Louise’s Marriage?</span></h2><p>On October 1, 2005, Ant and Louise married in a private ceremony. The couple is said to have dated for nine years before marrying. As a result, they very certainly met in 1996.</p><p>The couple had been together for several years and were satisfied with their situation. Ant was married twice and divorced twice. To begin, he married his first love, Louise, then divorced her after twelve years of marriage.</p><p>Soon later, the Wheeler Dealers host met and married Christina Haack in 2018. The newlyweds, however, divorced in November 2021.</p><h2><span id=When_Did_The_Ansteads_Split_Up>When Did The Ansteads Split Up?</span></h2><p>After a long marriage, the Anstead couple divorced in July 2017. As a result, the couple had been married for a year and a half. The ex-couple struggled to imagine their future together.</p><p>Their trajectories diverged as a result. Louise has also been reported to have remarried, though she has not verified this. There have also been no current developments regarding Storey’s new husband.</p><p>So, for the time being, we can presume she is single and working to improve her condition.</p><h2><span id=Who_has_Louise_dated_in_the_past>Who has Louise dated in the past?</span></h2><p>Storey’s dating history remains unknown. Before her marriage to Anstead, she had never been married or engaged. Her current dating status is similarly under wraps.</p><p>He had to have had at least one relationship before his first marriage in terms of dating history. He has never admitted anything about this, however. Regardless, he is alleged to have dated other women following his first divorce. Among them were Renee Zellweger, Christina El, Kenny Chesney, and others.</p><h2><span id=Are_the_Ansteads_Married>Are the Ansteads Married?</span></h2><p>Ant Anstead and Storey have two kids: a son and a girl. Archie Anstead is their son, while Amelie Anstead is their daughter. Amelie and her brother were born on September 29, 2003, and January 1, 2007, respectively.</p><h2><span id=Reasons_for_Ant_and_Louise8217s_Divorce>Reasons for Ant and Louise’s Divorce</span></h2><p>The Anstead’s divorced due to irreconcilable disagreements. This suggests that there was no particular reason for their breakup. Furthermore, neither party was deemed at fault for their eventual breakup.</p><p>Even though the couple is no longer together for various reasons, they remain good friends who support one another. Furthermore, they are concerned about their children’s future and do not want their previous relationships to tarnish it.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Juan Williams Of Fox News Quits The Five! 43 Years Married Life"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/juan-williams-of-fox-news-quits-the-five-43-years-married-life/"}{"1":74}'>Also Read <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Eniko Hart And Her Parents, Especially Her Mother, Are Very Close</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Television presenter</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Arlindo Grund</a></h3>Arlindo Grund estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
