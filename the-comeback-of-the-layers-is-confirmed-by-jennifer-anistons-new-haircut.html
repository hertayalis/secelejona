However, voluminous layers have lately become popular among Gen Z users on TikTok, with one influencer, <strong>Shay Sullivan, receiving a lot of feedback for her “iconic” haircut—a cross between Brigitte Bardot and Rachel Green.</strong></p><p>Thousands of people commented on the look, many of whom claimed that it reminded them of a character from Friends. What Rachel? However, jazzed up? One remarked, “It’s lovely.”</p><p>I got tonnes of layers all over like I always do, and then really intense facial framing because I really appreciate that dramatic look, Shay remarked when asked what she requested at the hair salon. My bangs used to be straight across, but this time I really wanted them to be more drapey, so she just tweaked the form and made them more slanted.</p><p>Influencers aren’t the only ones joining the trend. With her most recent outfit, Jodie Comer, one of the coolest actors around, is making a strong argument for the revival of lengthy layers, and we are totally on board.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Sam McKnight Personal (@sammcknight1)</a></p><p>Jodie’s new haircut dubbed a “contemporary take on the Rachel,” was created by Sam McKnight, a celebrity hairstylist who is an expert in establishing hair trends. He created Jodie’s jagged, layered style in his kitchen, and when the actress posted the finished product on Instagram, it received a lot of good feedback.</p><p>Jodie was also spotted sporting her new style at Wimbledon, where the sunshine brought out the most in her soft, golden hair color and face-framing shape. <strong>Jodie was included in a snapshot of the crowd that Sam McKnight posted on Instagram with the caption</strong>, “Jodie’s new 90s layers…get their first outing. #Coolgirl on a hot day.”</p><p>Although we definitely draw the line at rows of butterfly clips and hair mascara, we wouldn’t be surprised if the celebrity and TikTok influence further fuel the revival of nineties hair.</p><p></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><ul><li class="is-title post-title"><a href=#>Is Jennifer Aniston Believe&nbsp;That Brad Pitt Cheated On Her?
