In Israel, Jews constitute the vast majority of the population.</p><p>His acts were eventually shown to be entirely in support of Israel, rather than a religious connection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Norcross-Grew-Up-In-A-Lutheran-Faith.jpg><p>The 67-year-old American businessman is the eldest child of his late parents, George E.

Philadelphia Eagles NFL Week 9 game on November 5, 2023. Norcross was a season ticket holder at Lincoln Financial Field, where he displayed a draped American and Israeli flag from his luxury suite.</p><p>However, Eagles officials objected to him removing the flag, which he denied, resulting in his removal from the stadium.

Following the October 7th assaults, the US-Israeli flag he displayed was a protest that strongly backed Israel.</p><p>Furthermore, he thought it would be an important message because the Eagles used to address civil rights concerns as well as ethnic and global conflicts.</p><p>The entire world was watching the Eagles’ justification for their actions with bated breath.</p><p>Later, the NFL club issued a statement in which they stated that, while they sympathized with the victims of the attack, their ‘policy forbade signage featuring any form of non-game messaging.’</p><p>However the Norcross was reportedly removed from the game for being “physically and verbally abusive” to stadium staff.</p><p>Despite George’s threat to sue the NFL for his ejection, there has been no additional update on the situation.</p><h2>Social Media Accounts of George Norcross</h2><p>Unfortunately, there is no any social media accounts found regarding George Norcross.
