Novac has confirmed Stefan's choice was entirely his own saying in a press conference: "I'm not forcing him to play tennis.</p><p id=e1WHqQO_3QZ0 data-wc=59>"I never did that, not a single day have I told him that he has to do this. It's really only his pure desire to step on the court. So if he wants to embark on this journey, I guess I have to embark with him too. He's doing well so far, he's really in love with the sport."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/16e0a8fc2bbc-stefan-djokovic.jpg><p id=exOOwveFhfAe data-wc=30>However, it appears that one thing Stefan hasn't inherited is Novac's playstyle, with the tennis star even jokingly sharing his frustrations that Stefan appears to mimic his rival, Rafael Nadal.</p><h2>Tara, 6</h2><p id=eBMTTr2hODJJ data-wc=24>Novak and Jelena <a class=hm-link href=#>welcomed their second child on 2 September 2017</a> and Novac was over the moon when his little girl entered the word.</p><p id=e6dtvoI6N8A3 data-wc=62>"Jelena and I have been hand in hand on their journey and as a man, I have to send my love and admiration to every single women out there for going through so much pain and effort to create life, to bring life and raise a human being," he sweetly said.

"She is not into tennis at all," Novac shared ahead &nbsp;of last year's Australian Open.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9cffb1917983-jelena-djokovic-tara.jpg><p id=eUVD-04iqf46 data-wc=26>"She's into ballet and gymnastics. You know, she's a really cute girl. She keeps me grounded and humble, and she spins me around every single day."</p><p id=ejVFeybEkorn data-wc=39>And it sounds like Tara doesn't always support her father when he plays, with Novac revealing her favourite player is actually Russia's Andrey Rublev. "She likes him for his headband and for his energy and intensity," he told reporters.</p><h2>What has Novac said about fatherhood?</h2><p id=egxg240p9gh9 data-wc=29>It's clear that Novac loves being a dad, and he <a class=hm-link href=#>loves being supported by his children</a> when he plays, with Stefan seen imitating some of his father's point-winning strokes.</p><p id=entzMRlCmcGd data-wc=40>In one interview, Novac said: "It's always special for me the feeling to play in front of my son. I didn't have too many opportunities in my life to have that kind of sensation and experience. It's always very unique."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7b7e5fe1ae14-novak-djokovic-children-christmas.jpg><p id=e4qePsIt6NNV data-wc=61>The star's devotion to his children also means he's comfortable not to play in every tournament as he once shared: "Personally, as a father, I have learned that spending more time with children really, you know, grants you with incredible satisfaction and beautiful emotions and things that you carry for a long time that define fatherhood and parenthood in a way."</p><p id=eCxkD10hrW data-wc=21><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Meet John McEnroe's rarely-seen children Kevin, Sean, Emily, Anna & Ava - and they are identical to Wimbledon star dad</a></p><p id=elPDgKHXir data-wc=11><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Tim Henman's rarely-seen children: photos of his three grown-up daughters</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
