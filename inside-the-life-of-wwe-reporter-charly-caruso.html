She also created a web show named BackTalk Ball, which combines sports, entertainment, and comedy.&nbsp;</p><p>She made her debut in WWE in 2016. A close friend of hers gave her a backstage ticket to a WWE event in her home area, and at the show, she gave her resume to the WWE Senior Director of Talent Relations. Once a vacant position was available, the star auditioned and got the job. At the time, Charly had accepted another job as a sports anchor in Washington, but she chose the WWE one.&nbsp;</p><p>Her work was usually backstage as a ring announcer and as an interviewer to the wrestlers.
