Dr. Long, a trained medical professional with a PhD., explained that Scooby suffers from “Rhotic Replacement,” which is when the brain not only distorts speech but actually adds sounds to words.</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=156 data-injectable=false>This unique way of speaking makes Scooby-Doo a more interesting character, as it sets him apart from the typical dog character who can’t talk at all.</p><h2 id=h-but-why-can-scooby-doo-talk-while-others-can-t data-injectable=false>But why can Scooby-Doo talk while others can’t?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-130.png><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>But all of this aside, fans have spent decades theorizing as to why in the world of Scooby-Doo, some animals like Scooby and his relatives Scrappy-Doo and Scooby Dum, can talk but others, including Scooby’s girlfriend, the cocker spaniel Nova, can’t.</p><p data-characters=137 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>Reddit user “themightyheptagon,” theorized that it was because Scooby <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">began his life as a Soviet space dog.</a> According to this theory:</p><p>“Super-intelligent animals could potentially have been a great asset to the Soviet Space Agency. After all, why risk the life of a trained cosmonaut for a simple test flight when you could just send a dog who’s smart enough to record data, operate consoles, and understand complex commands over a radio?”</p><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>While intriguing, this doesn’t explain why the Kremlin’s top-secret military program would breed a dog so cowardly that he splits into four when he sees a “g-g-ghost.” According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another Reddit theory</a>, Shaggy is actually a descendant of Captain America, as evidenced by his ability to run at top speeds at the first sign of danger.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=728 data-injectable=true>This confusion as to why some dogs can talk and some can’t is similar to the debate surrounding classic Disney characters, Pluto and Goofy. It makes no sense that Goofy is able to walk on two legs and talk, while Pluto is just your everyday dog. It seems that animation can take a lot of liberties in their portrayal of dogs and their abilities, which is shown through Scooby-Doo.</p><h2 id=h-the-real-reason-behind-scooby-doo-s-peculiar-speech-pattern data-injectable=false>The real reason behind Scooby-Doo’s peculiar speech pattern</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-131.png><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=714 data-injectable=true>While these are fun, the question was finally answered in the second season of the 2010 series Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated. It was revealed that talking animals were the descendants of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Annunaki</a>, a race of beings from another dimension that took over the bodies of animals thousands of years ago.
