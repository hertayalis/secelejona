Well, this [Antifa flag] is meant to make fascists feel uncomfortable, so if you feel uncomfortable, I don’t really know what to tell you. Maybe you shouldn’t be aligning with the values that this [Antifa flag] is antithetical to,” Gipe told an interviewer from the group in apparent hidden-camera footage.</p><p>“I have 180 days to turn [students] into revolutionaries,” he said — adding that the way to combat teenage apathy is to “Scare the f–k out of them.”</p><p>He also admitted to urging students to show up at protests, including right-wing rallies to create an opposition for an extra credit assignment.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">In a video captured by a conservative advocacy group, Gabriel Gipe said that he gave extra credit to those who showed up to rallies. <span class=credit>ProjectVeritas.com</span></figure><p>“I post a calendar every week … I’ve had students show up for protests, community events, tabling, food distribution, all sorts of things … When they go, they take pictures, write up a reflection — that’s their extra credit,” said Gipe, adding he and his wife are left-wing political organizers.</p><p>Gipe also reportedly had a poster of Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong in his classroom, and taught about China’s Communist “Cultural Revolution” of the 1960s, noting that it “ultimately failed.”</p><p>Mao’s “Great Leap Forward” resulted in up to 55 million deaths and created the largest famine in human history.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Several students complained that the anti-fascist flag he had in his room bothered them, to which Gipe responded that it was supposed to make fascists uncomfortable. <span class=credit>ProjectVeritas</span></figure><p>In a Wednesday statement, the Natomas Unified School District <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged the video</a> and ensured the proper steps would be taken to “place the teacher on unpaid leave and fire the teacher.” The District did not name Gipe in the statement.&nbsp;</p><p>“Yesterday, a group released an undercover video that has been covered extensively. In this video, a teacher at Inderkum High School was recorded sharing his educational approach that is disturbing and undermines the public’s trust,” the district wrote. “The district is aware of the approach of the interview and the editing used to create the video.&nbsp; In following the principles of democracy, Natomas Unified staff is following due process, the law, and spent the past two days investigating the alleged teacher actions and his classroom environment.”</p><p>“As of today, this teacher was placed on paid leave because of his actions and choices in the classroom. Natomas Unified will be taking the legally required next steps to place the teacher on unpaid leave and fire the teacher.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Gipe said that he encourages his students to stand in opposition to the right-wing protestors. <span class=credit>ProjectVeritas.com</span></figure><p>The District made clear that the walls of the teacher’s classroom were cleared of all posters and signage, which included other material that was not appropriate.</p><p>The teacher reportedly used stamps with the images of Josef Stalin, Fidel Castro and Kim Jung Un to mark completed work from the students, during at least the 13 days of the 2021-2022 school year.&nbsp;</p><p>With regard to materials on the classroom walls, the district found that some of the materials “were added, at the earliest, May of 2021.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">President of Project Veritas, James O’Keefe addresses the Conservative Political Action Conference. <span class=credit>Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span></figure><p>“Leaders from the site have stated they do not remember the classroom looking as it did in years prior,” the district wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>“The actions and approaches taken by one teacher do not represent the overall staff, students and school community,” they added.</p><p>The video of Gipe came under fire <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">during a Wednesday school board meeting</a>, where parents and members of the community slammed the district, saying it “failed.”&nbsp;</p><p>“The school district has failed in my opinion…” said Luis Ortega, a resident of the district whose son recently graduated from Inderkum High School. “Because you allowed this indoctrination of Mr. Gabriel Gipe and his political ideology to flirt in his classroom. You have an opportunity to correct this. Everything has been brought to light and like everyone is saying, it doesn’t end with Mr. Gabriel Gipe. There are some deep-rooted issues within the district.”</p><p>“He was indoctrinating these kids every single day. He was abusing them, scaring them every single day,” said another resident of the community, only identified as Christopher.</p><p>“Where the hell was the principal? Where were the vice-principals? Where was the faculty of the school? Where was it superintendent, where was the rest of the district? Where were you?”</p><p>“You guys will be held accountable. This is because of you,” he added. “Okay? Gabriel Gipe is a symptom, not the sickness. The sickness is in the district.”&nbsp;</p><p>In their statement, the district acknowledged the concern of why the teacher’s objectives had not been addressed earlier, citing that the current principal of Inderkum High School has only been on the campus for 13 days. Being new to the school, she “has not had the time yet to get to know and assess all 100+ staff members.”</p><p>Over the course of 2018, 2019 and 2020, the teacher was subject to 25 classroom walkthroughs from site administration that reportedly showed “the teacher teaching standards and addressing the curriculum.”&nbsp;</p><p>For students and parents that have additional complaints regarding this teacher, the district is advising they contact the Constituent and Customer Service office so the concerns can be addressed promptly.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3J7j3JmaWpfpb%2BwecCnq6KekWLBpq3CoZyrZZeWr7O1xKVkoKGgmnqzsc%2Boqa2dlKHGbsPIpaNmmpVis6q%2BxJ1m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./remembering-baseball-player-alex-pearson-obituary-and-cancer-battle-inspires-heartwarming-viral-video.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Remembering Baseball Player Alex Pearson: Obituary and Cancer Battle Inspires Heartwarming Viral</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./it-was-all-about-avoiding-problems-with-the-police-early-associate-of-artist-banksy-on-anonymity.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>It was all about avoiding problems with the police: Early associate of artist Banksy on anonym</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./take-care-html.html>Beach House Take Care lyrics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./steph-lecor.html>Is Steph Lecor Dating Dj Khaled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jan-ullrich-net-worth.html>Jan Ullrich Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jon-taffer-net-worth.html>Jon Taffer Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./latest-sci-fi-news-multitasking-elon-musk-ruins-twitter-and-star-trek-as-netflix-finally-makes-a-movie-too-awful-to-release.html>Latest Sci-Fi News: Multitasking Elon Musk ruins Twitter and Star Trek as Netflix finally make</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes.
