Basically, it's a tough job! Even though we're on <a href=# class=T3D>Season 6 of <i>PLL</i> </a>, we're still left with just as many questions as when we started. Actually, there are probably even more now, with the most important being — <a href=# class=T3D>who is Charles?</a> And why is he so obsessed with Ali DiLaurentis and her friends?</p><p>Believe it or not, this <a href=# class=T3D>game of questions</a> has been going on for longer than you'd expect. Today is the fifth anniversary of the show's debut on ABC Family! Yes, seriously. The <a href=# class=T3D><i>PLL</i> pilot premiered on June 8, 2010</a>. That makes it five years of cliffhangers, murders, and, most obviously, lies.</p><p>If anything, <i>Pretty Little Liars </i>fans deserve a round of applause for putting up with <a href=# class=T3D>the show's plot twists</a> for that long! Just when we think we have the slightest idea about what's happening — NOPE. A new character appears, or an old character (who we thought was dead) actually isn't. Because of course, anything is possible in Rosewood.</p><p>In honor of the show's five years on the air, here's a round-up of 75 <a href=# class=T3D>unanswered <i>Pretty Little Liars</i> questions</a> that we've accumulated from Season 1 until now. Fingers crossed that we get some answers soon!</p><h3>1. Who is <a href=# class=T3D>Charles DiLaurentis</a>?</h3><p>P.s.
