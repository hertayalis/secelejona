In the political manoeuvrings which followed, Denmark ended up ceding Norway to Sweden in 1814. And although it retained its constitution and parliament, Norway was federated to Sweden and forced to accept that country's royal family as its own.</p><p id=eG4tC-n-0R data-wc=84>When that union was dissolved in 1905, Prince Carl of Denmark, the son of the king of Denmark and Princess Louise of Norway and Sweden, was invited to take over the throne of Norway. After a national referendum - which he had requested - showed that four out of five voters were in favour of his accession, Prince Carl agreed. He took on the name Haakon VII and moved into the royal palace in Oslo with his queen, Maud, and their young son Olav.</p><p id=evAEGwp614 data-wc=52>On April 9, 1940, Germany invaded Norway and the king and his family were forced to flee the capital in the middle of the night. In June, the country fell to the invading forces and King Haakon set up a government-in-exile in London, sending his family to safety in the United States.</p><p id=edlx-LswGo data-wc=20>When, at the end of the war, the royal family returned to Oslo, they did so to a rapturous welcome.</p><p id=eB2u2bH4h4 data-wc=60>Upon his death in 1957, Haakon was succeeded by Crown Prince Olav, popular with the Norwegian people as a result of his role as commander of the armed forces during the war. Very much a man of the people, Olav died in 1991, and was followed by Crown Prince Harald V who has perpetuated his father's egalitarian style of rule.</p><p id=eQHBj8Wa_O data-wc=85>King Harald<span>&nbsp;and Queen Sonja's children,&nbsp;</span>Crown Prince Haakon<span>&nbsp;and Princess Martha Louise, have proved extremely popular members of the next generation of young, modern European royals. Crown Prince Haakon's courtship of&nbsp;</span>Mette-Marit<span>&nbsp;was initially a subject of controversy due to her past and status as a single mother. She soon won the public around, however, and their 2001 nuptials were greeted with widespread celebration. In 2004 Mette-Marit gave birth to daughter Princess Ingrid Alexandra who becomes Norway's first ever female heir to the throne.</span><br></p><p id=espvDPMHX3h data-wc=9>The official royal website can be found at <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>www.kongehuset.no</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfp7y6rcutsGhsaGl%2BdoOOrZ%2BeZZ6kv7ixxqKYp2WipMaiuIyfmKahnK58</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./five-movies-like-napoleon-you-should-watch.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>5 movies like Napoleon you should watch right now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-stricker-illness-what-health-condition-does-he-have.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Steve Stricker Illness: What Health Condition Does He Have?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./take-care-html.html>Beach House Take Care lyrics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./steph-lecor.html>Is Steph Lecor Dating Dj Khaled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jan-ullrich-net-worth.html>Jan Ullrich Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jon-taffer-net-worth.html>Jon Taffer Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./latest-sci-fi-news-multitasking-elon-musk-ruins-twitter-and-star-trek-as-netflix-finally-makes-a-movie-too-awful-to-release.html>Latest Sci-Fi News: Multitasking Elon Musk ruins Twitter and Star Trek as Netflix finally make</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes.
