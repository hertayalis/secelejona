This is probably the prettiest salsa I’ve ever made, but I also love&nbsp;the flavor and texture variety that each tomato brings to the table bowl.&nbsp;Cherry tomatoes are sweet, green tomatoes are more tart and firm. I always find myself adding a pinch of sugar to my tomato salsa for balance, but that’s not necessary this time&nbsp;because of the sweet juicy mango.

I had these cute little pretzel buns last week so&nbsp;that’s how this recipe started. (Although you could use any kind of bun or sliced bread for this recipe). I first thought of making little veggie burgers, but since it’s a whopping 103 degrees(!) outside, I’ve been trying to use my oven as little as possible. Plus this chickpea salad is fast, easy, and cold,&nbsp;which is everything I want in a summer recipe.

I hope corn is in season where you are, because I have&nbsp;a pretty corny tostada recipe today. Let’s just say that I decided to go for the corn trifecta. I started by making&nbsp;some sweet and smoky corn hummus&nbsp;that is a great snack on its own. Then I slathered it onto crispy (baked) corn tortillas.&nbsp;Finally, I topped these with avocado and MORE&nbsp;grilled corn because, well, I was up to my ears in fresh summer corn, and I had to use it somehow. After spending the month of July eating pasta, I feel like a I needed a Texas re-tox.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Soup is my favorite thing to make regardless of the season – it’s comfy and cozy in the fall and winter, but just because it’s 100 degrees outside now doesn’t mean I don’t crave soup in the summer. Enter: gazpacho. This one is extra healthy (and bikini-season-friendly) because it’s made with green juice as the base. Since working on these recipes, with Evolution Fresh, I’ve been inspired to incorporate more green juices into my cooking. I got this idea by reading the ingredient list for&nbsp;their&nbsp;Sweet Greens and Ginger&nbsp;cold-pressed juice. It’s full of&nbsp;cucumber, apple,&nbsp;and ginger (among other greens), and sounded like&nbsp;the…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>First, thank you all SO much for your Italy foodie suggestions, the other day!&nbsp;They are all so so helpful. I’m writing this from&nbsp;the terrace of our small, yet very awesome, airbnb apartment in Rome. It’s picturesque, I’m not going to lie. What’s less idyllic is&nbsp;this jet lag. I always expect it to get easier, but every trip&nbsp;it seems to hurt a little more… of course, nothing I’m sure a little gelato won’t fix.

Mini skillets, mini pies, mini tacos – but my absolute favorite small food&nbsp;has to be mini pizzas. They’re quick and easy to make and a fun way to try lots of different&nbsp;toppings. These would be great for a summer party&nbsp;– you could even toss these little guys on the grill if you don’t want to heat up your house.

I enjoy them – they inspire me to get away from the computer and&nbsp;do fun things like hang out at&nbsp;pools with popsicles. (which I haven’t actually done, but the idea&nbsp;still lifts my spirit). For me, summer +&nbsp;list-making don’t go hand-in-hand, so I’ll just make one goal and that is to eat ALL of the peaches. I freaking love peaches. Their season is happening here and now in Texas so I’m&nbsp;I making&nbsp;the most of it with things like&nbsp;peach salads, peach salsa, and peach pops, just to…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>There are some food trends that I wish would end (sorry, oatmeal). There are others that I hope never end&nbsp;– like avocado toast.&nbsp;In my opinion, this one’s not going anywhere simply because&nbsp;avocados are awesome. And I’m totally fine with that. A few months ago, I posted&nbsp;a&nbsp;fall/winter version of my favorite smushed green snack and now here’s my spring take on the classic. I love the sweet/salty/creamy combination of avocado, coarse sea salt and strawberries.&nbsp;These are delightful little appetizer bites&nbsp;(or, for me, lunch), that take 2 minutes to put together. Don’t forget the fresh basil! My Best Tips for Perfect Avocado…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I’ll never forget the first time I bit into a radish. I was in Sunday school and I was maybe&nbsp;seven or eight. I’m not sure if they ate radishes in Bible times, but for whatever reason that morning’s lesson&nbsp;involved&nbsp;passing&nbsp;around new raw foods to&nbsp;try. I don’t remember much else about that day except the shockingly bitter taste that I couldn’t get out of my mouth until my family picked up Dunkin’ Donuts on the way home. I spent years picking radishes out of salads until I slowly came to love the crunch and slightly bitter bite – especially when thinly sliced,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I know – avocado toast is SO over, and even if it weren’t, you don’t need a recipe for it. This trend might be on it’s way out, but you’ll still find me (and pretty much everyone else on Instagram)&nbsp;happily smashing & snapping away. I usually keep mine simple – avocado, lemon, salt, pepper, and a sprinkle of hemp seeds. It’s a perfect combo that doesn’t need to be messed with, but since this was “dinner toast” for us one night last week, I thought I’d get a little fancier with the toppings.
