On what she referred to as #Wisdom Wednesday, Evelyn shared a motivational post on her Instagram account.</p><p class=fh>In an attempt to encourage those reading the post, the singer spoke to the importance of looking after oneself. The post didn't do too well for someone who is considered well known, only receiving just under one-thousand likes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/a35ca2731b87942973cf8b40d5efe64e1057391578593917.jpeg><p class=xj data-testid=image-source>Evelyn Braxton attends a film festival in Atlanta, Georgia | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>INSPIRATION AT ITS BEST</strong></p><p class=fh>Looking colorful, the post included a rainbow and a heart.

Although the share didn't receive a plethora of likes, the comment section was filled to the brim with positivity.</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>#LOOKATGOD</strong></p><p class=fh>The hashtag in Evelyn's post, namely "#LookAtGod" implies that the mother of two is very religious.

In 2020 Tamar tried to take her own life. Her sister Toni, who was obviously deeply affected by the incident, <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.eonline.com/news/1200671/tamar-braxton-slams-we-tvs-disgusting-braxton-family-values-trailer-following-hospitalization>expressed</a> the following:</p><p class=fh>"It seemed like a dream, a bad dream."</p><p class=fh>Luckily, Tamar survived and has received adequate mental health care going forward.

Speaking on a video with Roe Green Junior School, she expressed how difficult it was to look after her children in quarantine.</p><p class=fh>The Duchess claimed that it was absolutely exhausting. Speaking on the topic of helping her kids with math homework, Middleton rated herself a five out of ten.</p><p class=fh>It seems that in these strange times, it is imperative to follow Evelyn's advice and look after ourselves first. This period in history has been taxing on everyone and the opera singer truly seems to understand this.</p><p class=fh>However, Evelyn's inspirational posts do not end with self-care. Her Instagram page @evelynbraxton is filled to the brim with great advice such as celebrating your life as it is now and surrendering to all the ups and downs that may come our way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtsa2pka3q0scRmq6immWLBornAq2SbqpGtwbC60makqKVdmsOmuNinqmafn6Gxb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sol-salguero-net-worth-205592.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sol Salguero Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rey-mysterio-wwe-top-10-moments-retire.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rey Mysterio retiring: WWE legends top 10 moments as he prepares to retire with special send-off</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./take-care-html.html>Beach House Take Care lyrics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./steph-lecor.html>Is Steph Lecor Dating Dj Khaled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jan-ullrich-net-worth.html>Jan Ullrich Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jon-taffer-net-worth.html>Jon Taffer Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./latest-sci-fi-news-multitasking-elon-musk-ruins-twitter-and-star-trek-as-netflix-finally-makes-a-movie-too-awful-to-release.html>Latest Sci-Fi News: Multitasking Elon Musk ruins Twitter and Star Trek as Netflix finally make</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes.
