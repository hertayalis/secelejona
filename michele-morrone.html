Morrone (born on October 3, 1990)&nbsp;is an Italian supermodel, actor, and singer. All over the world, the man became famous after the premiere of the Polish erotic film “365 Days”. He portrayed the character of Massimo Torricelli, a member of a mafia family in Sicily.</p><p>In the movie, Laura Biel was played by <a href=# rel=noopener>Anna Maria Sieklucka</a>, who was kidnapped by Massimo and given a year to fall in his love. The director Barbara Bialowas and Tomasz Mandes, on April 27, 2022, released the second part of the movie, and they named it “<span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">365 Days: This Day</a></span>.”</p><p><img decoding=async title="Michele Morrone in movie 365 Days This Day" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Michele-Morrone-movie-365-Days-This-Day.webp alt="Michele Morrone movie 365 Days This Day" width=400 height=462 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>If you are from Italy, you might have seen Morrone as Claudio Cavalleri in “The Trial.” It was Alessandro Fabbri’s creation in which the lead characters were played by the actors like Vittoria Puccini and Francesco Scianna.</p><p>Michele made his debut in the Indian entertainment industry through a music video. He appeared as a model alongside Jacqueline Fernandez in Tony Kakkar and Neha Kakkar’s song “Mud Mud Ke,” which came on February 12, 2022.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Michele Morrone with sisters Antonella Morrone Angela Morrone and Nicolètta Morrone" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Michele-Morrone-sisters-Antonella-Morrone-Angela-Morrone-and-Nicoletta-Morrone.webp alt="Michele Morrone sisters Antonella Morrone Angela Morrone and Nicolètta Morrone" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Family Background</strong></h2><p>Michele Morrone (age 31 years) was born on October 3, 1990, in Reggio Calabria, Italy. His father, Natale Morrone, was a builder, and his mother, Angela Morrone, was a seamstress. He was only 12 when, unfortunately, his dad left the world. After Natale, the burden to raise Michele and his three elder sisters named Antonella Morrone, Angela Morrone, and Nicolètta Morrone, fell on her shoulders of Angela.</p><p>Schooling was not very good for Morrone, and he had to repeat the initial year of his high school studies because of his wrong behavior. But it was during his school time that he began attending the theater club.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Michele Morrone" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Michele-Morrone-net-worth.webp alt="Michele Morrone net worth" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Beginning as an Actor</strong></h2><p>Morrone started looking for work after school. He began his career as a waiter before moving to a construction site. The young man had to pass out leaflets to pay for his schooling.</p><p>After seeing the Harry Potter movie, Michele’s desire to be an actor began when he was a child. Despite his precarious financial condition, he opted to participate in professional acting classes at Teatro Fraschini di Pavia.</p><p>In 2011, he was entrusted with a cameo role in the film “Second Chance.” A three-part web series directed by Piergiorgio Seidit that was canceled after the first season. He also appeared in the music video of the Italian girl group “Makay” in 2012.</p><p>Three years later, the Italian dude starred in the series “The Teacher” and played the role of a character named Bruno Sacchi. It was a unique combination of comedy and mystery written by Cecilia Calvi, Domenico Matteucci, and four others.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Michele Morrone with Blanka Lipinska" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Michele-Morrone-with-Blanka-Lipinska.webp alt="Michele Morrone with Blanka Lipinska" width=400 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Having gained experience, Morrone began to play the leading roles in short films. He later appeared in “Sirene,” a mini-series in which his role was of a young guy named Ares, aka Gegè. Soon after “Sirene” casting directors of “L’Ultimo Giorno del Toro” contacted Morrone and offered him the role of Valerio. This is how he entered the world of cinema.</p><p>Two years after the first movie, Michele got the role of Luigi in “Bar-Joseph,” but it was a side role. The same year he worked with Nicholas Meyer in his TV series called “Medici” and played the role of Ship Captain.</p><p>Finally, the long-awaited leading role went to the actor in the Polish erotic film “365 Days,” and with its release on February 7, 2020, Morrone became world-famous. For his role on the show, millions of girls became his fans.</p><p>Later, when on June 7, 2020, the movie was made available on Netflix, Michele’s popularity skyrocketed. Michele has signed a three-year contract with the production company and will film two more parts to complete the trilogy.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Michele Morrone is 6' feet 2½ inches" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Michele-Morrone-is-6-feet-2½-inches.webp alt="Michele Morrone is 6' feet 2½ inches" width=400 height=486 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Music and Modeling Career</strong></h2><p>Morrone is a vocalist and professional musician who enjoys playing classical and electric guitar. Thanks to YouTube video tutorials, the actor learned to play the guitar at 25. Michele also sings to the accompaniment of a classical guitar or a group of musicians.</p><p>In 2020, he released his album called “Dark Room.” The album included ten hit songs, namely “Feel It,” “Watch Me Burn,” “Rain in the Hearth,” “Hard For Me,” “Dark Room,” “No One Cares,” “Drink Me,” “Do It Like That,” “Dad,” and “Next.”</p><p>The most successful period of Morrone’s modeling career was 2020, when the Dolce & Gabbana beachwear collection got launched. Acquaintance with the creative director of the American company Guess, Paul Marciano, helped Michele become the face of the men’s line of the autumn-winter collection of the firm in the same year.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Michele Morrone wife Ex-Rouba Saadeh" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Michele-Morrone-wife-Ex-Rouba-Saadeh.webp alt="Michele Morrone wife Ex-Rouba Saadeh" width=400 height=446 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Wedding, Divorce, and Kids</strong></h2><p>Morrone married Ruby Saada in 2014 after a long love affair. She was an ambitious designer before her marriage and was originally from Libya. Due to the birth of her first kid, Marcudo, she had to put her work on pause. Brado, the couple’s second child, was born in 2017.</p><p>Ruby is a designer and the founder of Le Paradis Des Fous, a design concept store that gathers and promotes talent worldwide. Her Instagram photos indicate that she works for Elie Saab, one of the world’s most well-known fashion designers.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Michele Morrone with his kids" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Michele-Morrone-with-his-kids.webp alt="Michele Morrone with his kids" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>To everyone’s surprise, Morrone got separated from his wife and applied for divorce. The couple did not reveal this until 2019. If we believe in some sources, the separation happened due to Morrone’s rumored relationship with D’Amelio.</p><p>Michele sank into deep despair after his divorce from Ruby. He posted on Instagram that he was quitting everything and no longer wanted to be creative. Later, Morrone returned to his acting career, determined not to give up on his passion.</p><p>It has been more than three years since the couple got divorced, but Michele continued to be a loving father. He assists his ex-wife financially and participates in the upbringing of the boys.</p><h2><strong>Michele Morrone Q&A</strong></h2><p><strong>Ques: Who was Michele Morrone’s wife?</strong></p><p>Ans: Rouba Saadeh.</p><p><strong>Ques: How old is Michele Morrone?</strong></p><p>Ans: He will turn 32 in 2022.</p><p><strong>Ques: The username of Michele Morrone’s Instagram account?</strong></p><p>Ans: “iammichelemorroneofficial.”</p><p><strong>Ques: Michele Morrone’s net worth?</strong></p><p>Ans: USD 14.73 Million.</p><p><strong>Ques: The Height of Michele Morrone is how much?</strong></p><p>Ans: 6′ 2½”.</p><p><strong>Ques: Name of Michele Morrone’s kids?</strong></p><p>Ans: Marcudo and Brado Morrone.</p><p><strong>Ques: Names of the parents of Michele Morrone?</strong></p><p>Ans: Angela (mother) and Natale Morrone (father).</p><p><strong>Ques: Does Michele Morrone have a YouTube channel?</strong></p><p>Ans: Yes, he has one, and it has more than 1.73 million subscribers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsr5WauG%2BvzqZmpqGTnbKtsYympquqn6OycA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./neon-genesis-evangelion-ending-explained.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Neon Genesis Evangelion ending, explained</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ken-rosato-wife-is-he-married-dating-history.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ken Rosato Wife: Is He Married?
