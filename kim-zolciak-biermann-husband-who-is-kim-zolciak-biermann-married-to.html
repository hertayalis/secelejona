He had interviewed her as a witness in a criminal investigation. The officer was fired, but later only served a 45-d ay suspension without pay.</p><p>Zolciak attended East Catholic High School in Manchester, Connecticut, and the University of Connecticut. She studied nursing. After graduating, at the age of 21, Kim moved to Atlanta where her parents had moved.</p><p>Kim joined “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” on October 7, 2008, and has been appearing on Bravo-related television ever since. In year four, Zolciak and her then-fiance were the subjects of a new spinoff show about their life getting ready for the wedding, “Don’t Be Tardy for the Wedding.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Kim began working on a country music album in 2008. The title of “Don’t Be Tardy,” the spinoff show, comes from Kim’s attempt to launch a legitimate music career. Her first single, dance track “Tardy for the Party,” premiered on the “Wendy Williams Show” and was written and produced by Kim’s fellow housewife,&nbsp;Kandi Burruss.&nbsp;</p><p>Kim left “The Real Housewives” in the midst of season five. Her final episode aired in December 2012. “Don’t Be Tardy” has run for seven seasons with season eight set to air in July 2020. Zolciak returned as a recurring role to “The Real Housewives” for season 10. Kim was scheduled to star in a new Bravo reality show, “NeNe and Kim:</p><p>The Road to Riches” with NeNe Leakes (a fellow “Real Housewives” cast member) but the network decided not to move forward with it. Zolciak appeared in season 21 of “Dancing With the Stars.”&nbsp;</p><p>In 2013, Burruss filed suit against Kim for profits earned from Tardy for the Party. Burruss’s attorney alleges her client wrote the song for Zolciak and that Zolciak released and sold it without Burruss’s permission. Burruss also sought a temporary restraining over to prevent future sales.</p><p>In 2016, Kim launched Kashmere, her own luxury beauty and lifestyle brand. Through Kashmere Kollections, Kim sells skin, hair, and body products, as well as blended oils and spa accessories.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Kim is the mother of six children. She has two daughters from previous relationships, Brielle Karenna (b. 1997) and Ariana Lenee (b. 2001).</p><p>She has a net worth of $300 thousand.&nbsp;</p><p>Before she landed her spinoff show&nbsp;Don’t Be Tardy&nbsp;(previously titled&nbsp;Don’t Be Tardy for the Wedding), Kim starred in&nbsp;RHOA&nbsp;from 2008 to 2012. Since she has been a Bravolebrity for quite some time, the Florida native’s salary is primarily thanks to her successful reality TV career.&nbsp;</p><p>Although she left&nbsp;RHOA&nbsp;in season 5, Kim returned as a recurring cast member in season 10. In May 2021,&nbsp;Don’t Be Tardy&nbsp;was canceled after eight seasons.&nbsp;</p><p>She was raised in a military family.
