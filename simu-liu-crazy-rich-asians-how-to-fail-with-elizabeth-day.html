So the fact Crazy Rich Asians had a predominantly Asian cast was a big deal.</p><p data-characters=149 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>He recalled thinking, “if I don’t get in Crazy Rich Asians, this could be it for me”. But tragically he didn’t make the cut.</p><p data-characters=176 data-current-count=176 data-injectable=false>He auditioned for the lead, but Henry Golding got the part. Then the casting team suggested he audition for the lead’s best mate Colin, but that role went to Chris Pang.</p><p>“I must have auditioned for that movie four times. At the very end, [they told me], ‘oh sorry, we found all our parts. It’s not gonna go your way’. I just remember being devastated at the time.”</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>Liu then claimed he heard some pretty soul-crushing words from the film’s director Jon M. Chu. But it’s worth mentioning Chu has denied he made the comments and he and Liu are pals now.</p><p>“Through some sort of broken telephone, whether it had gone through a studio exec or a casting director before it got to our side, [I heard], ‘Well Simu doesn’t have the X-factor. The It factor’. And that was just such a crushing blow for me.</p><p>“… It felt like someone was telling me that I just wasn’t good enough, that I just wasn’t likeable. I didn’t have that thing that made people want to watch it. It was at a time that was very difficult for me, I was trying to figure out whether I could be the lead character or whether I could only be a supporting character for my entire career.”</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=156 data-injectable=false>Simu Liu was recently cast in Greta Gerwig’s excitingly camp <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barbie</a> live-action flick. He described filming the project as “unfairly fun”.</p><p>“It’s very pink. There’s a lot of pink which is honestly a lot of fun to come into work everyday. There’s been multiple times on this production where we’ve looked at each other — the cast, crew, even Greta — and like, ‘how are we getting paid to do this? This is insane.’</p><p>It’s a good sign. Everyday feels like we’re just going to play. I can’t wait for people to see it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqqKlpWK5qsGMnKmasqliv6qvx2aYrKGRo8ButM6wZK2nXZuuqriMsKCtoF2auarGwJucraBdma66ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./thanksgiving-memes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Very Best Thanksgiving Memes in Honor of Turkey Day</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./star-wars-fan-theory-might-explain-why-the-lightsabers-in-ahsoka-look-so-weird.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Star Wars fan theory might explain why the Lightsabers in Ahsoka look so weird</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./take-care-html.html>Beach House Take Care lyrics</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./steph-lecor.html>Is Steph Lecor Dating Dj Khaled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jan-ullrich-net-worth.html>Jan Ullrich Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jon-taffer-net-worth.html>Jon Taffer Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./latest-sci-fi-news-multitasking-elon-musk-ruins-twitter-and-star-trek-as-netflix-finally-makes-a-movie-too-awful-to-release.html>Latest Sci-Fi News: Multitasking Elon Musk ruins Twitter and Star Trek as Netflix finally make</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ByteVibes.
