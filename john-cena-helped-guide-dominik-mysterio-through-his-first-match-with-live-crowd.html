His WWE in-ring debut came during an interesting time in company history, and he had to transition into performing in front of the live WWE Universe. Thankfully, he had John Cena around to help out.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic caused WWE to retreat to the ThunderDome for their programming. Dominik Mysterio actually debuted for the company when they were in the WWE Performance Center, performing in essentially a warehouse.</p><p>John Cena made a return to WWE in 2021 at Money in the Bank where he confronted the Bloodline. Dominik Mysterio’s first taste of action in front of a live crowd was during a dark match after SmackDown when he teamed up with Rey Mysterio and John Cena to defeat The Bloodline.</p><p>While speaking on <a href=#>Keepin’ it 100</a>, Dominik Mysterio remembered how John Cena helped him out during that big match. The 16-time world champion gave him advice during and after the match.</p><p>“When I first started, there was no crowd. So I heard the audio reaction and I would hear my dad kind of just giving me pointers. But then once we went to live crowd, my first live crowd match was with Cena and my dad against Roman [Reigns] and The Usos. So I had, I had John in there just kind of guiding me and telling me like what to listen for, how to do it and when, whether we were in that moment or not. He would tell me what to listen for exactly.”</p><p>The babyface team won that big match, with John Cena scoring the pinfall. In the end, it was a learning experience all around, and a great way for John Cena to make a return for one night in a tag team match where he could be protected.</p><p>John Cena doesn’t come around much anymore, but WWE is always in for a show, and a pop in the ratings, when he can appear. As for Dominik Mysterio, he is currently going through a bit of a character rebirth as he becomes a jail-hardened man who’s seen some things in his day.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>What’s your take on this situation with John Cena and WWE?
